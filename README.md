**Weather API with Redis Caching**

**Overview**

This is a Weather API built with Java and Spring Boot, which provides real-time weather information. The system utilizes Redis for caching weather data to reduce the load on external weather APIs and improve response time.

**Features**

Current Weather Data: Provides real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, conditions) based on a given city or location.

Redis Caching: Uses Redis to cache the weather data for frequently requested cities to avoid repeated calls to the external weather service.

External Weather Service Integration: The API integrates with a third-party weather service (like OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or any other provider).

Efficient API: Weather data is cached for a specified period, reducing the number of external API calls.

**Technologies Used**

Java 17 or higher: Programming language used to build the backend.

Spring Boot: Framework used to develop the backend API.

Redis: Used for caching weather data to speed up responses.

Spring Data Redis: Provides integration between Spring Boot and Redis.

External Weather API: Example integration with a weather API like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack.

Maven: For dependency management and project build.
